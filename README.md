# Deno KV Hackathon - If-Deno-Then-That (IFTTT "clone"-wannabe)

This is the result of only one day before the end of the Hackathon, its also my first Deno play here, so I had to cut some corners here:

- No Github Login, after the Hackathon definitely
- No deploy from Github Actions
- all KV features
- Good UI lol
- "good code"
- tests
- sanity
- probably some more stuff


## How to get started

1. Open Site or use known Workflow URL
2. Edit stuff and mark it as active
3. trigger the URL
4. cross fingers that it won't break :)

Note: if you call some APIs with secret keys, better try it once and the PLEASE regenerate that, its not a secure example, better fork it and use your own version with that, I'll shut it down after the Hackathon as well so that nothing happens at the end.
